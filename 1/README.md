This repository contains code templates, helper codes and data for Assignments.

1A
For the below questions, we provided you the data and some helper functions. 

You **_must_** use the given data, but you don't have to use the provided helper codes. You can modify the helper codes however you want.

In order to use the provided data easily, we suggest you to use Python. 

Let us know if you face any problems.

1.2: Likelihood of a Tree Graphical Model
For this task, we provided three different trees (small, medium, large). Each tree has 5 samples.

We want you to report the likelihoods of samples (_15 values in total_).

You can simply load Pickle files (`.pkl`) and access all the components of data. 
If you don't want to use Pickle, you can use the provided Numpy (`.npy`) and `.txt` files to access the _same properties_.

You can use packages such as `NetworkX`, `ete3` to work with the tree and graph structures. If you use codes from external resources, don't forget to cite them!

* _data_: A folder to store provided data.
* _q2_1A.py_: Some function templates for students (you don't have to use this file). Make sure to read comments at the top of the file. 
* _Tree.py_: Set of important components (Node and Tree Classes) and their functions. Again, you don't have to use this file.

We suggest you to run _Tree.py_ first to see the overall structure. 

1.4: Super Epicentra - Expectation Maximization
You are given the 2-dimensional locations of the 100 earthquakes, `X.txt`, and their strengths, `S.txt`.
